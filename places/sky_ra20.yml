description: Three-colour composite reproduced from one blue (B), one green-yellow
  (V) and one red (R) exposure, obtained with FORS1 at ANTU in the morning of March
  29, 1999. The field size is again 6.8x6.8 arcmin 2 . It shows the spectacular barred
  spiral galaxy NGC 6872 that is shaped like an &quot;integral sign&quot;. It is of
  type SBb and is accompanied by a smaller, interacting galaxy, IC 4970 of type S0
  (just above the centre). The bright object to the lower right of the galaxies is
  a star in the Milky Way whose image has been strongly overexposed and exhibits multiple
  optical reflections in the telescope and instrument. There are also many other,
  fainter and more distant galaxies of many different forms in the field. They are
  particularly well visible on the &quot;Normal&quot; and &quot;Full Resolution&quot;
  versions of the photo. The upper left spiral arm of NGC 6872 is significantly disturbed
  and is populated by a plethora of blueish objects, many of which are star-forming
  regions. This may have been be caused by a recent passage of IC 4970 through it.
  This interesting system is located in the southern constellation Pavo (The Peacock).
  It is comparatively distant, almost 300 million light-years away. It extends over
  more than 7 arcmin in the sky and its real size from tip to tip is thus nearly 750,000
  light-years. It is in fact one of the largest known, barred spiral galaxies. In
  order to image all of this extraordinary object within the available field of the
  FORS1 camera, the instrument was rotated so that the galaxy extends along the diagonal.
  For this reason, the orientation is such that North is to the upper right and East
  is to the upper left.

description: 'This Picture of the Week is a special treat: a first-light image from
  the newest resident of ESO’s Paranal Observatory, the SPECULOOS Southern Observatory.
  This planet-hunting machine aims to observe nearby but dim stars to locate exoplanets
  for other telescopes — such as ESO’s forthcoming Extremely Large Telescope (ELT)
  — to study in detail. Comprising four one-metre telescopes, each named after one
  of Jupiter’s Galilean moons,  SPECULOOS promises to open up new frontiers in exoplanet
  research. This image, however, is obviously not of a faint star, but of a galaxy
  called NGC 6902. Before a telescope starts its primary mission it must successfully
  undertake an event called “first light”: the first time it is used for a scientific
  observation. Astronomers typically pick well-known objects for this initial test
  of a telescope’s capabilities, which is half demonstration and half celebration.
  In this case, the team settled on NGC 6902 as the first-light target for the Ganymede
  telescope. The result was this stunning image of the spiral galaxy, which is found
  about 120 million light-years from Earth in the constellation of Sagittarius (The
  Archer). The galaxy’s spiral arms swirl outwards from a bright centre until they
  dissolve into streams of blue haze at the galaxy’s edge. If this is what Ganymede
  can produce as its first observation of something it wasn’t even designed to image,
  we have a lot to look forward to. Watch this space!'

description: Discovered in the year 1836 by John Herschel, NGC 6902 is a beautiful
  spiral galaxy located more than 130 million light-years away in the constellation
  of Sagittarius, the Archer. This image was taken with MUSE, the Multi Unit Spectroscopic
  Explorer instrument attached to one of the four 8.2-metre telescopes that make up
  the VLT, and shows the galaxy from a unique perspective. A zoom in towards the galaxy’s
  centre, the image shows a nuclear ring where the orange glow of intense star formation
  is visible.  Inside this ring lies a faint and small bar of stars. Researchers found
  that stars within it are distributed differently depending on their age, with younger
  stars aligned along the bar and older stars more dispersed. These locations of the
  young and old stars within the central bar of NGC 6902 confirm predictions made
  years earlier from simulations and models. This is the first time these predictions
  of galactic structure were confirmed with observations thanks to the incredible
  spatial resolution of the MUSE instrument.

description: AFGL 2591 is located within the Milky Way more than 3,000 light-years
  from Earth, in the constellation of Cygnus. Over the course of the last few thousand
  years, it has created a vast expanding nebula larger than 500 times the diameter
  of our solar system. The star is at least 10 times the size of the Sun, and over
  20,000 times as bright, but perhaps only one million years old. The wispy white
  and blue structure in the expanding nebula to the right of the young star is a huge
  outflow of gas and dust driven by the infall of material onto the star&#x27;s surface.
  Gemini scientists believe that the outflow is likely occurring symmetrically around
  the star - a second giant-sized expanding nebula to the left of the star is hidden
  from view by a dense and extensive disk (or torus) of material encircling AFGL 2591.

description: '&quot;A Mysterious Rash of Star Birth In this crisp Gemini North image,
  pink bubbles of glowing hydrogen gas spread across the arms of the face-on spiral
  galaxy NGC 6946 like a rash. This amazing infusion of color is fueled by the ubiquitous
  birth of massive stars throughout NGC 6946; these hot young stars blast copious
  amounts of ultraviolet radiation into their natal shrouds of hydrogen gas, causing
  the clouds to glow red. For reasons unknown, NGC 6946 has a much higher rate of
  star formation than all of the other large galaxies in our local neighborhood. The
  prodigious output of stellar nurseries in this extragalactic neighbor — which lies
  about 20 million light years away in the direction of the constellation of Cepheus
  — eventually leads to accelerated numbers of supernovae explosions. NGC 6946’s supernovae
  have occurred in rapid-fire fashion for tens of millions of years. Over the past
  century, eight supernovae are known to have exploded in the arms of this stellar
  metropolis. NGC 6946 is, in fact, the most prolific known galaxy for supernovae
  during the past 100 years. These events have led to its popular nickname, the “Fireworks
  Galaxy.” If we could compress just a million years of NGC 6946’s history into a
  time-lapse movie, lasting but a few seconds, we would bear witness to a stream of
  nearly constant outbursts of light as new stars flare into view, while old ones
  expire in spectacular explosions.&quot; Technical Details: Acquisition Date(s):

description: 'These images were obtained with the MOSAIC CCD camera at the prime focus
  of the Mayall 4-meter reflector, and show a 36 arc minute field of view that contains
  the well known Pelican nebula, located at the northwest rim of the giant HII region
  W80 (the North America/Pelican Nebula) in Cygnus. These narrow-band images, obtained
  in the red light of recombining hydrogen atoms and singly ionized sulfur, reveal
  a population of hitherto unrecognized shocks which trace outflows from forming stars
  embedded within the molecular clouds that rim the nebula. The visibility of these
  protostellar outflows is enhanced by the ultraviolet radiation field of several
  massive stars located off the image. This radiation is eroding the surrounding molecular
  cloud. In regions shadowed by dense clumps of gas and dust, parts of the dense and
  cold molecular cloud survive to produce the long pillars of dusty material. A faint
  jet (known as Herbig-Haro object 555) squirts out of the tip of one of the pillars,
  apparently indicating the presence of an unseen protostar. North is up and west
  is to the right in this image. This image was produced by NOAO Survey Program &quot;Deep
  Imaging Survey of Nearby Star-Forming Clouds&quot;, and is the subject of a related

description: NGC6946, the “Fireworks Galaxy,” lies between 10 and 20 million light-years
  away on the border between the constellations of Cepheus and Cygnus, and was discovered
  by Sir William Herschel (1738-1822) on September 9, 1798. It continues to fascinate
  astronomers, who estimate that it contains about half as many stars as the Milky
  Way. They often use it to study and characterize the evolution of massive stars
  and the properties of interstellar gas. As viewed in the new Gemini optical image,
  we see only the “tip of the iceberg” of this galaxy. Its optical angular diameter
  is about 13 arcminutes, but viewed at radio wavelength at the frequency of neutral
  hydrogen (1420 Mhz or 21-cm line), it extends considerably more than the angular
  diameter of the Moon. This Gemini North Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS)
  image of NGC6946 utilizes a selective filter specifically designed to detect the
  radiation emanating from the starbirth regions. Additional filters help to distinguish
  other details in the galaxy, including clusters of massive blue stars, dust lanes,
  and a yellowish core where older more evolved stars dominate.

description: This image was obtained with the wide-field view of the Mosaic camera
  on the Mayall 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. WR 134 is the
  brightest star below the center of the image. It is a Wolf-Rayet star, which is
  a very hot, massive star that is blowing off its outer layers. The layers are blown
  off at very high speeds. Part of these layers can be seen as the blue arc in the
  upper-left part of the image. The arc was created when the outer layer collided
  with the ambient nebula surrounding the star. The image was generated with observations
  in Hydrogen alpha (red) and Sulphur [SII] (blue) filters. In this image, North is
  left, East is down.

description: 'This image of the clouds of gas and dust next to the “neck” and “body”
  of the Pelican Nebula was taken by the National Science Foundation’s Mayall 4-meter
  telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, AZ. Narrow-band filters
  were used to isolate the red emission lines of hydrogen and singly-ionized sulfur.
  The image reveals many previously unseen shockwaves, evidence for powerful outflows
  from newly formed stars embedded within the molecular clouds that rim the nebula.
  North is up and west is to the right in this image. This image was produced by an
  NOAO Survey Program known as the Deep Imaging Survey of Nearby Star-Forming Clouds,
  which is led by John Bally of the University of Colorado and Bo Reipurth of the
  University of Hawaii. It is also the subject of a related press release. Note: the
  large “donut” in the middle is an artifact of the coma corrector in the KPNO 4-meter
  that was not completely removed in the reduction. This image has been clipped to
  remove ragged edges caused by the dither pattern of the different fields. An un-clipped
  version, with higher resolution, is also available.'

description: A new wide-field image of Pickering&#x27;s Triangle taken with the National
  Science Foundation&#x27;s Mayall 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory
  is being released today in Austin, Texas, at the 211th meeting of the American Astronomical
  Society. Pickering&#x27;s Triangle is part of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant,
  which includes the famous Veil Nebula. It is located about 1,500 light-years from
  Earth, in the constellation Cygnus, the Swan. Astronomers estimate that the supernova
  explosion that produced the nebula occurred between 5,000 to 10,000 years ago; the
  entire shell stretches more than six full Moons in width across the sky. This new
  image was obtained in September 2007 by Travis Rector and Heidi Schweiker by combining
  two full pointings of the 64-megapixel NOAO Mosaic-1 imager mounted on the National
  Science Foundation&#x27;s historic Mayall 4-meter telescope. The image was released
  in Austin, Texas, at the 211th meeting of the American Astronomical Society, and
  was the subject of NOAO Press Release 08-01.

description: Informally known as the &quot;Soap Bubble Nebula&quot;, this planetary
  nebula (officially known as PN G75.5+1.7) was discovered by amateur astronomer Dave
  Jurasevich on July 6th, 2008. It was noted and reported by Keith Quattrocchi and
  Mel Helm on July 17th, 2008. This image was obtained with the Kitt Peak Mayall 4-meter
  telescope on June 19th, 2009 in the H-alpha (orange) and [OIII] (blue) narrowband
  filters. In this image, north is to the left and east is down. PN G75.5+1.7 is located
  in the constellation of Cygnus, not far from the Crescent Nebula (NGC 6888). It
  is embedded in a diffuse nebula which, in conjunction with its faintness, is the
  reason it was not discovered until recently. The spherical symmetry of the shell
  is remarkable, making it very similar to Abell 39.

description: This image was obtained with the wide-field view of the Mosaic camera
  on the WIYN 0.9-meter telescope on Kitt Peak, Arizona. It shows faint filaments
  that are part of a large supernova remnant called the Cygnus Loop. The Cygnus Loop
  is a giant supernova remnant. It is the remains of a star that exploded 5000 to
  10,000 years ago. The distance to it is estimated at about 1500 light years. Because
  of its immense size, it contains several individually named objects, including NGC
  6992 and IC 1340 on the left side as well as NGC 6960 and Pickering&#x27;s Triangle
  on the right. Separate, high-quality images of these four objects can also be found
  in this gallery. To create this image, nine separate images were taken and stitched
  together. The full-resolution image is over 600 megapixels in size. It covers an
  area of the sky that is about 45 times that of the full moon. The image was generated
  with observations in the Oxygen [OIII] (blue), Sulphur [S II] (green) and Hydrogen-Alpha
  (orange) filters. In this image, North is up, East is left. Please note that the
  full resolution version of this image is extremely large at more than 24,000 pixels
  on a side, and the file size of the TIFF is 1.65 Gigabytes. Read more about this
  image in NOAO Press Release 12-09.

description: IC 5067, a star forming region in Cygnus, is also sometimes called the
  Pelican Nebula. This image was taken May 24, 2009 by Gregor Rothfuss, a first time
  visitor to the Kitt Peak Advanced Observing Program, with the help of Kitt Peak
  Visitor Center operator Flynn Haase. They used the VC 20-inch RC telescope with
  an SBIG STL-6303E camera and AstroDon LRGB filters. Exposures were 120:40:40:40
  respectively. This was Mr. Rothfuss’s first experience doing CCD imaging. The Kitt
  Peak Visitor Center program, which receives no financial support from the observatory,
  offers paying guests the opportunity to do their own observing and imaging.
